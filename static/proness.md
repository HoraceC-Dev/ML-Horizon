# ML Horizon

**ML Horizon** is an educational knowledge-sharing platform dedicated to empowering users of all ages and skill levels to learn **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** on their own terms. In a rapidly evolving field like ML/AI, it can be challenging for learners to find a path that suits their goals, knowledge level, and interests. ML Horizon bridges this gap by offering a **customizable learning experience** that caters to each user’s unique journey, ensuring they get precisely the knowledge they need without the distraction of irrelevant content.

## Inspiration
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are experiencing unprecedented growth in popularity and application. However, with the vast amount of content available, many learners struggle to find resources that align with their learning objectives. **ML Horizon** was inspired by the desire to streamline this process, providing learners with a platform where they can shape their **educational journey** without navigating through an overwhelming amount of content. We wanted to create a space where anyone—regardless of age, background, or experience—could build a strong, customized foundation in ML/AI and move from conceptual understanding to **hands-on projects**.


## What It Does

**ML Horizon** offers a dynamic, AI-driven learning experience through several core features:

1. **AI-Powered Chatbot**  
   Equipped with an **extensive knowledge base** curated from reputable, **high-quality sources**, the chatbot allows users to ask specific questions and dive deep into technical concepts. This feature empowers users to get personalized answers and guidance on complex topics in real-time.

2. **Customized Project Generator**  
   Tailored to each user’s coding ability, experience level, and interests, the project generator designs unique projects that align with the user’s goals. The generated projects cover various **algorithms**, applications, and skill levels, giving users a practical outlet to apply their knowledge.

3. **Personalized Programming Support**  
   ML Horizon includes a **Coding Assistant** that provides guidance when users encounter challenges during implementation. Rather than completing the work for them, the assistant offers contextual hints and **step-by-step support**, encouraging users to reach solutions independently.

## How We Built It

This platform was developed using a suite of advanced technologies, each integral to its functionality:

- **AWS**  
  Leveraging AWS services like Bedrock API, Sonnet v2, Titan Embedding v2, Secret Manager, S3 bucket, and Elastic Beanstalk to power our backend infrastructure and ensure scalability, security, and efficient data management.

- **Langchain and LangGraph**  
  These libraries enabled us to construct complex agent structures, enhancing the interactive and responsive nature of our chatbot.

- **MongoDB**  
  Our platform relies on MongoDB as a robust database solution to manage user data, project details, and knowledge base content.

- **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search**
  Using MongoDB Atlas's vector search algorithm, our platform combines semantic and keyword-based retrieval to enhance our RAG system. This approach improves response relevance by aligning search results more closely with user intent and content context.

- **External Integrations**  
  We incorporated **Brave Search** for accurate, real-time information sourcing and **ScrapingBee** to gather data from various sources for the knowledge base.

## Challenges We Ran Into

Throughout development, we encountered several challenges, including:

- **Time Constraints**  
  Time was a significant limitation. We worked intensively to deliver the best possible product within the given timeframe. With additional time, we believe we could further improve and refine our platform.

- **Integrating Diverse Technologies**  
  Integrating multiple technologies, including AWS services, third-party APIs, and complex backend structures, was time-consuming and required careful management to ensure a cohesive user experience.

- **Limited Promotional Credits**  
  The promotional credits we received did not cover some key AWS services we needed, resulting in considerable time spent negotiating and working with AWS to obtain access to these services.

- **Building a Comprehensive Knowledge Base**  
  Constructing a knowledge base that could anticipate user questions was a significant challenge. We needed to predict a wide range of user queries and dynamically transform them into web queries to provide high-quality responses.

- **API Usage Limits**  
  Many of the APIs we relied on had strict free-usage limits, which frequently required us to explore and integrate alternative options to maintain the platform's functionality.
