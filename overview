My team is developing a platform that centralizes AI/ML tutorials and information, designed for educational purposes and targeting beginners to intermediate-level AI/ML enthusiasts. The platform uses an LLM-based data pipeline (powered by LangChain and LangGraph) to extract, organize, and embed high-quality resources from the internet, stored in MongoDB for efficient retrieval. Users interact with a front-end AI agent (LLM) equipped with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) retriever, which accesses the MongoDB database. Through this interface, users can ask questions, explore AI/ML concepts, and even work on personal projects with the support of the platform.
